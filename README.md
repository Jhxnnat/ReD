# ReD is a simple retro looking (not yet) text editor made with raylib

Red stants for Retro eDitor, maybe Raylib eDitor (just coincidence)

### Some sources: 

- raylib [repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
- [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) are used
- [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning-on-demand.html) book (used this to make text tokenization)
